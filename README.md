## Introduction

Stick Hero is a platformer where you control Stick-Hero, navigating between pillars by extending a stick. Your goal is to collect cherries, reach the destination, and achieve the highest score possible. Embrace the challenge and enjoy the thrilling gameplay!

## Game Mechanics

1. **Stick-Hero Control:** Use keyboard input to stretch out a stick and bridge gaps between pillars.

2. **Multiple Pillars:** Navigate Stick-Hero through platforms of varying widths and heights.

3. **Reviving Feature:** Collect cherries to revive Stick-Hero once during gameplay. Cherries and related scores are deducted after revival.

4. **Timing is Crucial:** Time your stick extension carefully to land on the next platform. Failure results in Stick-Hero falling into the abyss, ending the game.

5. **Collect Rewards:** Flip Stick-Hero upside down to collect cherries and increase your score.

6. **Scoring System:** Aim for high scores by collecting rewards and challenge yourself to reach the top of the leaderboard.

### How to Play
