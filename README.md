## Introduction

Welcome to Stick Hero, an engaging game inspired by the classic Stick Hero, implemented using JavaFX and object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts. This project is developed as part of the Advanced Programming course at IIIT Delhi, aiming to emulate the core mechanics of Stick Hero while introducing creative elements.

## Game Summary

Stick Hero is a platformer where your character, Stick-Hero, traverses between pillars by stretching out a stick. The goal is to collect cherries, reach the destination, and achieve the highest score possible. Embrace the challenge and enjoy the thrilling gameplay!

## Game Mechanics

1. **Stick-Hero Control:** Use keyboard input to control Stick-Hero, who can stretch out a stick to bridge gaps between pillars.

2. **Multiple Pillars:** Navigate Stick-Hero through various platforms with different widths.

3. **Reviving Feature:** Collect cherries to revive Stick-Hero once during gameplay. Cherries and related scores are deducted after revival.

4. **Timing is Crucial:** Time the stick extension correctly to land on the next platform. Failure results in Stick-Hero falling into the abyss, ending the game.

5. **Collect Rewards:** Flip Stick-Hero upside down to collect cherries, adding to the player's score.

6. **Scoring System:** Achieve higher scores by collecting more rewards. The game encourages players to aim for the top spot on the leaderboard.
